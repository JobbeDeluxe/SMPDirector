# SMP Director ‚Äî v0.1.3-rc1
**Dynamic event director for SMP servers (Paper 1.21.4+, Java 17+).**  
SMP Director continuously measures each player's tension (combat, hunger, darkness, nearby mobs) and occasionally triggers small events to keep survival gameplay fresh and balanced ‚Äî things like a light ambush, a relief-drop care package, or a short weather cell.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Per‚Äëplayer Tension System** with live bossbar.
- **Smart Event Director**: weighted by tension *band* (calm/normal/high), per‚Äëevent cooldowns, and a global per‚Äëplayer gap with jitter so events don‚Äôt feel periodic.
- **Three built-in events**:
  - **Ambush** ‚Äî spawns a few hostile mobs at a safe minimum distance.
  - **Relief Drop** ‚Äî places a barrel with useful loot (never empty; delayed fill for Paper 1.21.4 stability).
  - **Weather Cell** ‚Äî short, localized storm with occasional lightning effects.
- **Config auto‚Äëmerge**: new keys are filled in from defaults on boot.
- **Admin tools**: start/stop/pause, list events, reload config, manual trigger.
- **Lightweight**: pure server‚Äëside, no dependencies (PlaceholderAPI optional as soft‚Äëdepend).

---

## üöÄ Quick Start
1. Place the built JAR into `plugins/` and start the server once.
2. A default `config.yml` is generated (missing keys are auto‚Äëfilled on upgrades).
3. Use `/director start` to enable the director tick if you paused it, or just let it run (enabled by default on boot).
4. Watch the **Tension** bossbar and try `/director trigger relief_drop` for a quick test.

> **Java**: 17+ required.  
> **Server**: Paper **1.21.4** recommended (works on 1.20.x+).

## üß† How it Works (Tension & Triggering)
- Every second, SMP Director **decays** tension and **samples** inputs per player:
  - Taking damage, death (events also add tension via listeners).
  - Low hunger, darkness, number of nearby hostile mobs.
- Every `global.evaluateEverySeconds` the director **evaluates** each player:
  1. If the player is within `global.joinGraceSeconds` after login ‚Üí **skip**.
  2. If the player hasn‚Äôt waited at least `global.minSecondsBetweenEvents` (+ random `minSecondsBetweenEventsJitter`) after the last event ‚Üí **skip**.
  3. Roll a **base chance** based on tension band (`calm/normal/high`). On success ‚Üí pick a weighted event (per‚Äëband weights) that isn‚Äôt on cooldown.

Tension bands default to:
- **calm < 20**, **normal 20‚Äì79**, **high ‚â• 80** (configurable).

---

## üì¶ Built-in Events
### 1) `ambush`
Spawns a small group of mobs around the player, at least `minDistance` blocks away so the player isn‚Äôt hit immediately.
- **Key config**: `count`, `radius`, `minDistance`, `mobSet`, `cooldownSeconds`, and `weight` per band.
- **Notes**: Each mob is tagged and targets the player if the type supports it.

### 2) `relief_drop`
Places a **barrel** near the player and fills it with items from `lootPool`.  
Filling happens **a few ticks later** to avoid empty inventories on Paper 1.21.4. If nothing passes the RNG, fallback items are inserted so the barrel is **never empty**.
- **Key config**: `radius`, `removeAfterSeconds`, `minItems`, `maxItems`, `lootPool`, `cooldownSeconds`, and `weight` per band.
- **Loot grammar**: `MATERIAL[:MIN-MAX][@P]`
  - Examples: `BREAD:6-12@85%`, `IRON_INGOT:4-12@0.7`, `DIAMOND:1-3@15%`, `ENCHANTED_GOLDEN_APPLE:1@3%`
  - `@` accepts either `0‚Äì1` or `%` form (e.g., `0.25` or `25%`).
- **Removal**: If `removeAfterSeconds > 0`, the barrel gets removed **only if empty** at that time.
- **Troubleshooting**: If you *still* see empty barrels, increase the delay in code (currently 3 ticks) or check region protection plugins that might block container updates.

### 3) `weather_cell`
A brief local storm with a few lightning effects near the player. Clears automatically after `durationSeconds`.

### Tunables that most affect pacing
- `global.evaluateEverySeconds` ‚Äî how often to consider triggering.
- `global.minSecondsBetweenEvents` ‚Äî base required gap per player.
- `global.minSecondsBetweenEventsJitter` ‚Äî adds randomness (0‚ÄìJ seconds) on top of the gap.
- `global.baseTriggerChance.*` ‚Äî per‚Äëband chance per evaluation.
- Per‚Äëevent `weight` and `cooldownSeconds` ‚Äî selection weight and event cooldown.

## üß™ Testing & Debugging
- `/director debug` to see your current tension.
- `/director list` to list event IDs.
- `/director trigger relief_drop` for an immediate barrel test (should never be empty).
- Watch the console for warnings from other plugins that may block block‚Äëstate updates or container edits.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build

## üì¶ Compatibility & Notes
- Paper **1.21.4** recommended (tested); should work on **1.20.x**+.
- **PlaceholderAPI** is a soft‚Äëdepend (not required).
